                <p>My name is Stephanie Schmitt and I want to welcome you to my website.  This is the first website that I have ever created, and it focuses on my <strong>personal interest and hobbies</strong>.  
                    I included information about myself, the books I enjoy reading, my work contact information, as well as pictures from my favorite vacation destinations.  
                    I really hope you get to know a little more about me after visiting my website. </p>
                <br>
                <p>This website was created using <em>HTML and CSS</em>. I used Visual Studio Code as my editor.  I learned how to create this website using HTML and CSS in my <em><b>LIB841 Information System Design</b></em> class at Eastern Kentucky University. 
                   I recommend everyone try and create a basic web page using HTML to understand how a website works.  The most challenging part for me, other than HTML/CSS was learning how to create tables.  
                   After I understood how to create a table, header, and put in the data, it made the overall look of the page so much better. This has been a real learning experience!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have included additional pages (<a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a>,<a href="booklist.html">Book Recommendations</a>,<a href="contactinformation.html">Contact Information</a>, and <a href="photogallery.html">Photo Gallery)</a> for my website, as well as a diagram at the bottom showing the navigational structure.
                      You can visit those pages by clicking on the links at the top menu of this page.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Also in LIB841, we are learning how to create a website using Google Sites.  I plan on using this for my school library page.  The <a href="contactinformation.html">Contact Information</a> page will show you how to access that site!</p>
