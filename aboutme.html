            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Huntington, WV, and raised in Staffordsville, KY.  Staffordsville is a few miles outside the city limits of Paintsville.
               I have a younger brother, Jason, who lives in Lexington, KY. I went to Paintsville High School, and graduated in 1998.  
               I went to Morhead State Univesity and majored in elementary education.  After graduating college in 2001, I got married.</p>  
            <br>
               <p>I completed my masters in 2006.  I always wanted to get my Rank 1, but having three kids put those plans off until now.  Today, 
                I live in Staffordsville, the same place I grew up.  Currently, I am a 2nd grade teacher at Paintsville Elementary School.
                I have been a classroom teacher for <em>21 years</em>.  I have just learned that I will be transitioning into the LMS position at my school for 2023-2024 school year.  
                I'm very excited to begin this new role.</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>I have three children</i>.  My oldest son, Conner, is 19 and just finished his first year of college.  My middle son, Grant, is 16 and has finished up his Sophomore year of high school.
                  My daughter, Reagan, is 12 and will begin middle school in the fall.  <strong>I enjoy reading, traveling, and spending time with my family</strong>.</body></p>

            <p>I really love to travel and have been blessed to have been able to have gone to so many places, both inside and outside the United States.
                    Hawaii was one of my all time favorites.  This is where my husband and I went on our Honeymoon!  The weather was great, we got to see Pearl Harbor, 
                    and watch a Luau.  This was the first time I have been outside the Continental US.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The following year, we traveled to Australia and Fiji.  This too was an amazing vacation, and so many memories were made during that trip.  We go to
                sail by the island that the movie Castaway was filmed, and learned about how the islands were used during WWII.  I hope I'm able to go back and visit 
                those places again.  It's hard to believe it has been 21 years.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Our cruises in 2003 and 2022 were fantastic.  We go to stop at so many places and I really enjoyed the relaxation on being on a boat.  I would definately
                recommend anyone to go on a cruise if you haven't already!  We have another cruise planned in 2024.  Our destinations will be Dominican Republic, San Juan,
                Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, and St. Martin.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have included some pictures of my vacations on my <a href="photogallery.html">Photo Gallery</a>. I hope you get a chance to check them out!</p>
